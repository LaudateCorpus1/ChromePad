If you’re using a ‘new’ unconfigured motherboard and have errors 2200 or 2201 at boot, I have good news and bad news.

BAD NEWS: This requires WINDOWS. It might work in Debian with DOSBox. Personally I found it easier to just set up a laptop with an old Vista DVD.

GOOD NEWS: This fixes the problem and gets rid of the errors.

1. Download the Hardware Maintenance Diskette here: https://download.lenovo.com/ibmdl/pub/pc/pccbbs/mobiles/i7tm38us.exe

2. Inside WINDOWS install i7tm38us.exe and run it(in Vista run in XP mode as admin) with a sacrificial USB drive plugged in.

3. Plug the USB drive into the X220 and walk through the steps depending on which errors you encountered.


4. Reboot without the USB drive and check that it boots without errors.

5. Generate a NEW UUID.
